# Hospitality_Analysis_Power-BI

The purpose of this project is to analyse the revenue of different hotels and take the business insights from the dashboard on how to improvise the revenue.

Built a new visual using matrix table, which can be utilized for different purpose of analyze. 

By referring different cancellation polices of different hotels, it seems that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge is deducted from the booking cost.
